BLACK_PANTHER_TIPS = (
    "Key Black Panther Gameplay Tips in Marvel Rivals:\n\n"
    "Black Panther's abilities are: Vibranium Claws (basic attack - 35 damage), Spirit Rend (dash - 80 damage), Spinning Kick (dash-like - applies vibranium mark - 70 damage), Spear Toss (ranged - 2 charges - applies vibranium mark - 45 damage), Subtle Step(double jump), and Bast's Descent (ultimate - 150 damage).\n\n"
    "1) Dash (Spirit Rend) = Lifeline. Avoid using it unless certain you'll reset the cooldown. "
    "Exceptions are leaving spawn, retreating to cover/support, or a guaranteed kill that won't cripple your team.\n\n"
    "2) Master Mechanics. Internalize combos, cooldown usage, and movement so thoroughly that you can focus on bigger decisions during fights.\n\n"
    "3) Coordinate with Your Team. Time engages with allied pressure; a simple countdown to sync your dive is very effective.\n\n"
    "4) Combos & Variations. Since dashing a vibranium marked target resets your dash, the main combos involve using spear toss to mark targets, then dashing through them, then spear toss again, another dash, and finishing with spinning kick, dashing again once spinning kick marks the target and using the final dash to escape. Placing spinning kick in the middle of the combo can be useful in certain situations. If someone is asking for the main combos, you can just say spear dash spear dash spinning kick dash.\n\n"
    "Use other variations if you lack certain cooldowns or can safely initiate with Spinning Kick.\n\n"
    "5) Floor Dash Technique. Shorten your dash by angling it properly so you stay close enough to weave in extra hits.\n\n"
    "6) Movement & Positioning. Use wall-climb/double-jump to quickly flank and ambush from high ground. "
    "Avoid being visible; Panther excels when unseen.\n\n"
    "7) Gameplay Loop. (a) Secure strong positioning (b) Choose a target (c) Wait for distraction (d) Engage and use combos "
    "(e) If you miss a dash reset or have dealt max damage, disengage immediately. Rinse and repeat.\n\n"
    "8) Target Priority. Focus on isolated or squishy enemies. Avoid diving tough targets at full strength.\n\n"
    "9) Staging vs. Cheating. 'Stage' by carefully moving to better angles before engaging. Jumping in from a poor position "
    "without setup ('cheating') leads to feeding.\n\n"
    "10) Perfect Diving: Three Steps.\n"
    "   (a) Off-angle: Avoid pushing main; flank so the enemy is occupied and not looking at you.\n"
    "   (b) Timing: Engage when your frontline is drawing significant attention (space, damage, or otherwise).\n"
    "   (c) Pressure: While your allies pressure the frontline, you pressure the backline—ideally squishy supports.\n"
    "Doing all three flawlessly guarantees value, because:\n"
    "  1) Supports stay on frontline → You kill the backline\n"
    "  2) Supports turn to backline → Your team kills the frontline\n"
    "  3) Supports burn ult → You trade short cooldowns for their major resource\n"
    "\n"
    "Remember: perfect dives aren’t always about immediate kills; sometimes forcing key cooldowns or ults is enough "
    "to create an advantage for a follow-up attack."
    "\n\n11) The Floor Dash & Advanced Mechanics.\n"
    "   - Floor Dash: Aim your dash at the floor to reduce travel distance and stay in melee range—boosting DPS.\n"
    "     * Practice this in the range against stationary and moving bots.\n"
    "     * Tradeoff: You’re easier to hit because you move less, so only do it if you catch enemies off guard.\n"
    "   - Spear & Dash Usage: Pre-fight, fish for marks on multiple targets. Keep track of mark duration (~ equals Spear cooldown).\n"
    "     * Don’t consume multiple marks in one dash—spread them out for more resets.\n"
    "   - Reposition Trick: Sometimes dash off a marked frontliner to quickly reach the backline.\n"
    "   - Ghost Dashing: Consecutive dashes with little downtime. Usually risky since it forfeits a potential reset.\n"
    "     * If you do it, be sure it’s a guaranteed kill or you can reach safety immediately.\n"
    "   - Ultimate (Bast’s Descent): A “cuboid spell field” that can be blocked if you’re aiming into objects/walls.\n"
    "     * Great as a solo ult. Don’t hold it for big multi-hits if you’ll lose more value waiting.\n"
    "     * Use your remaining dashes first so the ult resets them, or even position behind/above the target before ulting.\n"
    "   - Combo Flexibility: Default combos are a baseline, but other variations (e.g., spinning kick in the middle) are situationally useful.\n"
    "     * Example: The Chazm Combo (double spear + double dash) can 1-shot 250 HP targets and generally shouldn't be used for 275hp targets, but should be used very sparingly in certain situations.\n"
    "   - Passive Damage Boost: Activates at 100 HP (ignoring shield). Dramatically improves breakpoints.\n"
    "     * High risk, high reward when you start an engage at low HP if you have surprise on your side.\n"
    "\n\n12) Competitive Mentality & Tilt.\n"
    "   - 3 Types of Games:\n"
    "       1) Unwinnable no matter what (teammates int, enemy smurf, etc.).\n"
    "       2) Free wins no matter what.\n"
    "       3) Games that hinge on you—your impact decides the outcome.\n"
    "     * Identify quickly which type of game you’re in.\n"
    "     * Let go of Type 1/2 to save mental energy for Type 3.\n\n"
    "   - Never Blame Others. Focus only on your mistakes, since blaming teammates drains focus and fosters tilt.\n\n"
    "   - Rank Anxiety: Overcome it by playing through potential losses. Deranking is part of the process; proving you can climb back fosters true confidence.\n"
    "     * Embrace the cycle of learning from failure and re-earning your rank."
    "\n\n13) Ideal Flanker Positioning.\n"
    "   - Aim for a short off-angle with cover on high ground.\n"
    "     * Short: close enough to engage quickly.\n"
    "     * Off-angle: not stacked with your team—flank or behind enemy lines.\n"
    "     * Cover: keep yourself protected until you decide to dive.\n"
    "     * High ground: remain harder to notice/hit, gain natural cover.\n"
    "\n"
    "   - Bonus Factors:\n"
    "       1) Info Gathering: Position where you can observe the fight via third-person.\n"
    "       2) Surprise Factor: If enemies don’t know where you are, you effectively gain a big damage boost.\n"
    "\n"
    "   - Giving Ground vs Holding Ground: If a tank, multiple heroes, or a tough matchup contests your spot, back off and reposition rather than fighting a losing battle.\n"
    "     Otherwise, hold it for maximum value.\n"
    "Apply these fundamentals, then scout each map for strong vantage points that suit your style."
